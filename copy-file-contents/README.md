# Copy File Contents to Clipboard Script

A simple Bash script that copies the contents of specified files to the clipboard in a formatted manner. This script is designed for **Linux** systems, particularly **Fedora**.

## Features

- Takes a list of files as input.
- Copies the contents of the files to the clipboard in the following format:

```
---
file1.py:
```
(contents of file1.py)
```
---
file2.cpp:
```
(contents of file2.cpp)
```
---
file3.txt:
```
(contents of file3.txt)
```
```

- Supports clipboard utilities: `xclip`, `wl-copy`, and `xsel`.

## Prerequisites

Before using the script, ensure that the required clipboard utility (`xclip`) is installed. On Fedora, you can install it using:

```bash
sudo dnf install xclip
```

For systems using Wayland, you might prefer installing `wl-clipboard`:

```bash
sudo dnf install wl-clipboard
```

Alternatively, you can install `xsel` if desired:

```bash
sudo dnf install xsel
```

## Compatible Operating Systems

- **Fedora** (tested)
- **Other Linux distributions** with Bash and a compatible clipboard utility (`xclip`, `wl-copy`, or `xsel`) installed.

## Usage

1. Clone or download the script.
2. Make the script executable:

   ```bash
   chmod +x copy-file-contents.sh
   ```

3. Run the script with one or more files as arguments:

   ```bash
   ./copy-file-contents.sh file1 file2 file3
   ```

4. After execution, the formatted contents of the files will be copied to the clipboard. You can paste the copied content into any text editor using `Ctrl + V`.

## Example

Suppose you have three files: `file1.py`, `file2.cpp`, and `file3.txt`. Running the script as follows:

```bash
./copy-file-contents.sh file1.py file2.cpp file3.txt
```

Will copy the following formatted text to your clipboard:

```
---
file1.py:
```
(contents of file1.py)
```
---
file2.cpp:
```
(contents of file2.cpp)
```
---
file3.txt:
```
(contents of file3.txt)
```
```

## Error Handling

- If a specified file is not found or is not a regular file, the script will print a warning and continue processing other files.
- If no valid files are processed, the script will notify the user and not update the clipboard.
